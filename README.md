- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Robert Mead (@rmead7)
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data analytics, applied mathematics, reading and staying active.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Machine Learning (Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforced), Deep Learning and Time Series with Python. I'm interested in doing analyse on healthcare, retail and sports data. I am interested in understanding how to apply data analytic techniques to assist in healthcare optimization with current problems in the healthcare field.
